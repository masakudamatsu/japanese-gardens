The book says that the whole garden was constructed to be seen from this viewpoint.

              The group of rocks furthest to the right is made of three rocks. One large lying stone is flanked by two flat stones. This symmetric composition, however, is also marginalized at the edge of the garden, not in the center. The right flat stone even disappears from sight when seen from the viewpoint, as it hides behind the large rock.

            The Rock Garden's Message

              Now it is clear that nothing is emphasized throughout this garden. I start wondering why. The designer of this garden, who remains anonymous despite many attempts of historians to identify, must have had a purpose. What message did he or she try to convey to the visitors of this garden?
            </p>
            <p class="page__paragraph--above-paragraph">
              I remember that each rock in a zen garden is often interpreted as an unfulfilled desire in our mind. Once I see the rocks in Ryoan-ji Rock Garden as my own unfulfilled desires, the walled rectangular garden space begins to look like a metaphor of my inner self.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              No emphasis on any of the fifteen rocks, I conclude, can therefore be interpreted as the following message:
            </p>
            <p class="message__container">
              <em class="message">Don’t fixate on <span class="message__line2">one particular thing</span> <span class="message__line3">in our mind.</span></em>
            </p>
            <p class="">
              This idea is central to the preaching of Zen Buddhism to live a happy life. Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past. Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing should be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement of these fifteen rocks within the walled rectangular plot.

              That’s not easy, however. The lack of focus makes us feel uneasy. We want to fulfil our desires. There needs to be an element of calmness to accept the preaching of no emphasis.

              The unity achieved by these similarities across the groups of rocks calms us down. If all these rocks took completely different shapes, we would be unable to relax at all and reluctant to accept the merit of having no emphasis in our mind.

            Ryoan-ji Rock Garden manages both to place no emphasis and to achieve the overall unity, creating the serenity that echoes the preaching of zen: the key for living a happy life is not to be preoccupied with one particular thing.

            It is so easy to forget this simple principle of happiness in our everyday life. Whenever I get preoccupied too much with my unfulfilled desires, I pay a visit to Ryoan-ji Rock Garden, which has been there since the 16th century to remind us of an ideal way of life.

            Arrive in the early morning when the temple opens its gate (8am from March to November, 8:30am from December to February). Sit down in the viewpoint as described above. Observe how the rising sun constantly changes its way to illuminate the garden as the time passes by (that is, no fixation on a particular moment).

            By 10am, a flock of tourists start arriving and counting how many rocks there are (which is so off the point about this garden). That is the time to leave and take a stroll around the pond garden outside (which you will realize also avoids creating any focal point).
