      <section>
        <p>My previous two visits to the most famous zen garden left me unsure of what's really great about the garden. Upon my third visit, I learned from a book on Japanese gardens that this garden must be viewed from just halfway between the left and right edges of the garden. I sat down on the garden-viewing terrace at that viewpoint and contemplated for a while. And I reached nirvana.</p>
        <h3>Emphasis on Nothing</h3>
        <p>The garden is all about the composition of fifteen rocks within a rectangular space filled with white gravels (representing the ocean). The composition's theme is the emphasis on nothing, echoing the Buddhism's most important teaching of shedding your desire.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <figure>
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-look-straight.jpg" alt="Central view of Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
        </figure>
        <p>When I look straight, there is no stone straight ahead. The composition is split between two groups of stones on the right and on the left. Nothing is really emphasised.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <figure>
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-look-left.jpg" alt="Leftward view of Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
        </figure>
        <p>When I look to the left, there is again nothing between me and the corner of the garden. The view is split. Nothing is emphasised. </p>
        <p>The group of rocks on the right consists of two rocks. There is no center either.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-leftmost.jpg" alt="The front view of the leftmost group of five rocks in Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
        </figure>
        <p>The group of rocks on the left is the most magnificent composition in this garden only if seen from the front of it. One large, well-shaped rock stands in the middle, flanked by two small standing rocks and two flat rocks farther away.</p>
        <p>But viewed from the center of the garden, one of the small standing rocks cannot be clearly seen as the large rock blocks its entire view. Its composition is destroyed.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <figure>
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-look-right.jpg" alt="Rightward view of Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
        </figure>
        <p>Looking to the right from the viewpoint, I see three groups of rocks. But there is none of them between where I am and the corner of the garden.</p>
        <p>The group of rocks on the left consists of one large standing rock on the left and two smaller ones on the right, instead of the large one flanked by two smaller ones. Again there is no emphasis. The middle group of rocks is composed of two rocks of equal size. That is, no emphasis on anything.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-rightmost.jpg" alt="The front view of the rightmost group of three rocks in Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
        </figure>
        <p>The right group of rocks is made of three rocks if seen from its front. One large lying stone is flanked by two flat stones.</p>
        <p>Seen from my viewpoint, however, the right flat stone is completely hidden behind the large rock. Thus, no emphasis is made.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The composition of no emphasis, however, makes those who haven't reached nirvana feel uneasy. There needs to be an element of serenity to accept the composition. The Ryoanji Zen Garden achieves this by uniting the five groups of rocks with the similarity of rock shapes.</p>

        <p>The leftmost group of rocks is connected to the middle left group by the small standing stones...</p>

        <p>...and also to the rightmost group by the pairs of flat flaking stones. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>It's also connected to the middle group of rocks by the shape of standing rocks:</p>

        <p></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The middle left, the middle, the middle right, and the rightmost groups of stones are all connected by the shape of lying rocks (looking like the back of a beast).</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-middle-left.jpg" alt="The front view of the middle-left group of two rocks in Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-middle-right.jpg" alt="The front view of the middle-right group of three rocks in Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-second-right.jpg" alt="The front view of the second-from-right group of two rocks in Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
          <img src="resources/images/ryoanji-rightmost.jpg" alt="The front view of the rightmost group of three rocks in Ryoan-ji Zen Garden">
        </figure>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This way, the zen garden manages to place no emphasis but still achieves the overall unity, creating the serenity that zen aims to preach.</p>
        <p>Personally, it relieves me from my anxiety about living in Japan after fourteen years abroad. The key is not to be preoccupied with one particular thing. Be unfocused without losing the same attitude towards all my desires and anxieties coming from them.</p>
