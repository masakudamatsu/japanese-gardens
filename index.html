            The Rock Garden's Message
          </h2>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph--first
          page__element--margined">
            Now it is clear that nothing is emphasized throughout this garden. I start wondering why. The designer of this garden, who remains anonymous despite many attempts of historians to identify, must have had a purpose. What message did he or she try to convey to the visitors of this garden?
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph page__element--margined">
            I remember that each rock in a zen garden is often interpreted as an unfulfilled desire in our mind. Once I see the rocks in Ryoan-ji Rock Garden as my own unfulfilled desires, the walled rectangular garden space begins to look like a metaphor of my inner self.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph  page__element--margined">
            No emphasis on any of the fifteen rocks, I conclude, can therefore be interpreted as the following message:
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph  page__element--margined">
            <em class="message">Don’t fixate on one particular thing in our mind.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph  page__element--margined">
            This idea is central to the preaching of Zen Buddhism to live a happy life. Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past. Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing should be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement of these fifteen rocks within the walled rectangular plot.

          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph  page__element--margined">
            That’s not easy, however. The lack of focus makes us feel uneasy. We want to fulfil our desires. There needs to be an element of calmness to accept the preaching of no emphasis.

            Ryoan-ji Rock Garden manages both to place no emphasis and to achieve the overall unity, creating the serenity that echoes the preaching of zen: the key for living a happy life is not to be preoccupied with one particular thing.

          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph page__element--margined">
            It is so easy to forget this simple principle of happiness in our everyday life. Whenever I get preoccupied too much with my unfulfilled desires, I pay a visit to Ryoan-ji Rock Garden, which has been there since the 16th century to remind us of an ideal way of life.

            If this article makes you feel like visiting Ryoan-ji temple, I would suggest the following:
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph page__element--margined">
            Arrive in the early morning when the temple opens its gate (8am from March to November, 8:30am from December to February). Sit down in the viewpoint as described above. Observe how the rising sun constantly changes its way to illuminate the garden as the time passes by (that is, no fixation on a particular moment).
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph section__paragraph  page__element--margined">
            By 10am, a flock of tourists start arriving and counting how many rocks there are (which is so off the point about this garden). That is the time to leave and take a stroll around the pond garden outside (which you will realize also avoids creating any focal point).
