        <p id="first-paragraph" class="content__text">My previous two visits to the most famous zen garden left me unsure of what's really great about the garden. Upon my third visit, I learned from a book on Japanese gardens that this garden must be viewed from just halfway between the left and right edges of the garden. I sat down on the garden-viewing terrace at that viewpoint and contemplated for a while. And I reached nirvana.</p>
        <h2 class="content__title content__title--section">Emphasis on Nothing</h2>
        <p class="content__text">The garden is all about the composition of fifteen rocks within a rectangular space filled with white gravels. The composition's theme is the emphasis on nothing, echoing the Buddhism's most important teaching of shedding your desire.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="content__title content__title--photo">Look straight ahead</h3>

        </figure>
        <p class="content__text content__text--caption">When I look straight ahead, there is no stone at the center of gaze. The composition is split between two groups of stones on the right and on the left. Nothing is really emphasised.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="content__title content__title--photo">Look to the left</h3>
        <figure class="content__image content__image--view">

        </figure>
        <p class="content__text content__text--caption">When I look to the left, there is again nothing between me and the corner of the garden. The view is split. Nothing is emphasised. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="content__title content__title--photo">Look to the right</h3>
        <figure class="content__image content__image--view">

        </figure>
        <p class="content__text content__text--caption">Looking to the right from the viewpoint, I see three groups of rocks. But there is none of them between where I am and the corner of the garden.</p>

      <section>
        <h3 class="content__title content__title--subsection">Five sets of rocks</h3>
        <p class="content__text">The 15 rocks of the garden are grouped into five sets. The middle three sets lack the focus while the other two groups, having a symmetric composition, are marginalized in this garden.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="five-sets">
        <h3 class="content__title content__title--photo">The middle-left</h3>

        <p class="content__text content__text--caption">The middle-right set consists of two rocks, each in a peculiar shape. But neither is emphasized more than the other.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="content__text content__text--caption">The group of rocks furthest to the the left is the most magnificent composition in this garden if seen from the front of it. One large, well-shaped rock stands in the middle, flanked by two small standing rocks and two flat rocks farther away. But the whole group is located at the left edge of the garden, not at the center.</p>

        <p class="content__text content__text--caption">The group of rocks furthest to the right is made of three rocks if seen from its front. One large lying stone is flanked by two flat stones. This symmetric composition, however, is also located at the edge of the garden, not in the center.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="content__title content__title--section">Unity as a whole</h2>
        <p class="content__text">The composition of no emphasis, however, makes those who haven't reached nirvana feel uneasy. There needs to be an element of serenity to accept the composition. The Ryoan-ji zen garden achieves this by uniting the five groups of rocks with the similarity of rock shapes.</p>

        <h2 class="content__title content__title--section">End result: serenity</h3>
        <p class="content__text">The garden manages both to place no emphasis and to achieve the overall unity, creating the serenity that zen aims to preach. The key for living a life is not to be preoccupied with one particular thing. It is so easy to forget this simple principle in daily life. The Ryoan-ji zen garden has been there since the 16th century to remind us of an ideal way of life.</p>

      <h2 class="content__title content__title--section">Tips for your visit</h3>
      <p class="content__text">Arrive when the gate opens (8am from March to November, 8:30am from December to February). Sit down in the middle of the viewing platform. Observe the way the morning sunlight illuminates the garden changes as the time passes by. When a flock of tourists start arriving and counting how many rocks there are, leave and take a stroll around the pond garden outside. Ryoan-ji temple's official website explains <a href="http://www.ryoanji.jp/smph/eng/rode/index.html">how to get there</a>.</p>
