            Pick any travel guide for Kyoto. I'm sure you’ll find Ryoan-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple famous for its Rock Garden (pictured above).
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            This zen garden is made of fifteen rocks, surrounded by patches of moss, laid out in the ocean of gravels on a walled rectangular plot.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            And that's it...
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            If you have been to this garden, you must have been utterly puzzled during your visit. Too abstract and too minimal. I also scratched my head during my first visit to the garden. My second visit a year later didn’t help me figure out anything, either.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            During the third visit, however, the whole garden started to make sense to me. It taught me how to live a happy life, with the layout of the fifteen rocks used as the &ldquo;textbook&rdquo;.

          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            The key to understand this cryptic garden is to see it from where you're supposed to. I've learned from a book on Japanese gardens that we must see Ryoan-ji Rock Garden from a viewpoint halfway between the left and right edges of this rectangular garden (indicated with the gray arrow in the garden floor plan below). The whole garden was constructed to be seen from there.

          <p class="content__text">
            Once we sit down and see the garden from this viewpoint, the layout of fifteen rocks starts taking on its meaning.

              When you look straight ahead, there is no stone at the center of gaze. The composition is split between two groups of rocks on the right and on the left. Nothing is really emphasized.

              Next, turn your head to the left while sitting in the same viewpoint. There is again nothing between you and the corner of the garden. The view is split. Nothing is emphasised.

              Finally, turn your head to the right while still staying at the same viewpoint. There are three groups of rocks. But again there is none of them between where you are and the corner of the garden.

          <p class="content__text">
            So there is nothing emphasized in this garden. The theme of emphasis on nothing also penetrates into how fifteen rocks are arranged into five groups, spreading from left to right. Let’s start looking at the middle three groups.

            Each of the other two groups of rocks arranges the largest rock in the center with a symmetric composition. However, they are literally marginalized in this garden.

              The group of rocks furthest to the the left is the most magnificent composition in this garden if seen from the front of it. One large, well-shaped rock stands in the middle, flanked by two small standing rocks and two flat rocks farther away. But the whole group is located at the left edge of the garden, not at the center. When seen from the viewpoint, the symmetric composition is destroyed.

            Emphasis on Nothing
          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            So throughout this garden nothing is emphasized. What does it mean to us?
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Each rock in a zen garden is known to represent an unfulfilled desire in our mind. Here in Ryoan-ji Rock Garden, the walled rectangular space is a metaphor of our inner self. No emphasis on any of the fifteen rocks can therefore be interpreted as one important principle of Zen Buddhism to live a happy life: don’t fixate on one particular thing in our mind.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past. Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing should be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement of these fifteen rocks in the walled rectangular plot.

            Unity to calm us down

          <p class="content__text">
            That’s not easy, however. The lack of focus makes us feel uneasy. There needs to be an element of serenity to accept the preaching of &lsquo;no emphasis&rsquo;.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Ryoan-ji Rock Garden is kind to us, however. It visually calms us down by uniting the five groups of rocks with the similarity of rock shapes.

            The unity achieved by these similarities across the groups of rocks unconsciously calms us down. If all these rocks took completely different shapes, we would be unable to relax at all. The similarities are subtle, however. They never take the front position on the stage. The main character here is the lack of emphasis. The similarities of rock shapes are just the supporting actors, and they are good ones.

            End result: serenity
          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            Ryoan-ji Rock Garden manages both to place no emphasis and to achieve the overall unity, creating the serenity that zen aims to preach. The key for living a happy life is not to be preoccupied with one particular thing. It is so easy to forget this simple principle in daily life. Ryoan-ji Rock Garden has been there since the 16th century to remind us of an ideal way of life.

          <p class="content__text">
            If this article makes you feel like visiting Ryoan-ji temple, I would suggest the following:
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Arrive in the early morning when the temple opens its gate (8am from March to November, 8:30am from December to February). Sit down in the viewpoint as described above. Observe how the rising sun constantly changes its way to illuminate the garden as the time passes by (that is, no fixation on a particular moment).
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            By 10am, a flock of tourists start arriving and counting how many rocks there are (which is so off the point about this garden). That is the time to leave and take a stroll around the pond garden outside (which you will realize also avoids creating any focal point).
