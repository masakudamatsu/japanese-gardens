            Pick any travel guide for Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan. You’ll find Ryoan-ji, a Buddhist temple famous for its Rock Garden (pictured above).
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            If you’re visiting Kyoto, you may wonder if the Ryoan-ji temple is worth a visit. Perhaps you believe that such a touristy religious site is boring.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Think again. Ryoan-ji Rock Garden teaches you how to live happily, with the layout of rocks in a small rectangular plot as the only “textbook”. There is no such place elsewhere in the entire world.

          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            To appreciate the garden’s preaching, however, there is one must-do thing during your visit: view the garden from halfway between the left and right edges of this rectangular garden (indicated with the black arrow in the garden floor plan below). The whole garden is constructed to be seen from this viewpoint.
            </p>

          </figure>
          <p class="content__text">
            Once you sit down and see the garden from this viewpoint, the layout of fifteen rocks starts taking on its meaning.

              When you look straight ahead, there is no stone at the center of gaze. The composition is split between two groups of rocks on the right and on the left. Nothing is really emphasized.

          </section>
          <section>

            <p class="content__text content__text--caption">
              Next, turn your head to the left while sitting in the same viewpoint. There is again nothing between you and the corner of the garden. The view is split. Nothing is emphasised.

            <p class="content__text content__text--caption">
              Finally, turn your head to the right while still staying at the same viewpoint. There are three groups of rocks. But again there is none of them between where you are and the corner of the garden.

            Five sets of rocks
          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            So there is nothing emphasized in this garden. The theme of emphasis on nothing also penetrates into how fifteen rocks are arranged into five groups. Let’s start looking at the middle three groups.

            The other two groups of rocks focus on one largest rock in the center with a symmetric composition. However, they are marginalized in this garden.

              The group of rocks furthest to the the left is the most magnificent composition in this garden if seen from the front of it.

But the whole group is located at the left edge of the garden, not at the center.

            Emphasis on Nothing
          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            As seen above, emphasis on nothing permeates throughout the garden. What does it teach us?
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Each rock in a zen garden is known to represent an unfulfilled desire in your mind. Emphasis on none of these rocks is therefore interpreted as the most important principle of zen to live a happy life: don’t fixate on one particular thing in your mind.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past. Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing should be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement of these fifteen rocks in the walled, rectangular plot.

            That’s not easy, however. The lack of focus makes us feel uneasy. There needs to be an element of serenity to accept the preaching of no emphasis.
          </p>
          <p class="content__text">
            Ryoan-ji Rock Garden is kind to us, however. It calms us down by uniting the five groups of rocks with the similarity of rock shapes.

          </h2>
          <p class="content__text">
            The Ryoan-ji Rock Garden manages both to place no emphasis and to achieve the overall unity, creating the serenity that zen aims to preach. The key for living a life is not to be preoccupied with one particular thing. It is so easy to forget this simple principle in daily life. The Ryoan-ji zen garden has been there since the 16th century to remind us of an ideal way of life.

          <p class="content__text">
            Arrive in the early morning when the gate opens (8am from March to November, 8:30am from December to February). Sit down in the viewpoint as described above. Observe the way the morning sunlight illuminates the garden changes as the time passes by. When a flock of tourists start arriving and counting how many rocks there are, leave and take a stroll around the pond garden outside (which you will realize also avoids creating any focal point).
